		<h1>What we're about</h1>
		<p class="lead">We love creating things here. It's a passion of ours, but more than that, we love making things other people can enjoy too.</p>

			<h4>Games</h4>
			<p>Making entertaining games is something that we really enjoy doing. There is a lot of excitement when it comes time to release a game we've been working on for awhile. We love it when our fans are able to enjoy something we've worked on for so long.</p>

			<h4>Apps</h4>
			<p>Several projects we've worked on are not necessarily games. Sometimes an idea sparks, and we decide to make a fun app. Other times it's more of a tool that we see as being very useful, and often it's something that may supplement another product. We enjoy building these apps and working on these projects a lot as well.</p>

			<h4>Tutorials</h4>
			<p>As much as we enjoy making games, we love teaching people how to make their own even more! Creating games and applications is such an amazing thing, when you literally create something that started as an idea, and are able to share it with anyone. This is why we try to pass our skills on to anyone that wants to learn.</p>
