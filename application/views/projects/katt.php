	<h4>KATT (Kill All The Things) is our first HTML5 game.</h4>
	<p>We made this game to test out some of the (then) new features of HTML5, to see if it was a viable platform for developing games. Fortunately, we were pleasantly suprised to learn that it was (and still is).</p>

			<h4>About</h4>
			<p>In the year 30XX, Humans and Drones clashed for control of the universe. After decades of fierce conflict, humanityâ€™s presence in international space began to dwindle, and, the Drones overran all major human civilization. It was a total loss. International Space Command HQ was reduced to ash. Whatever was left of the fleet scattered across the far reaches of space to hide from the dreaded armies of the Drones. Although the future of humanity is left bleak by the Drone bombardment, an ace pilot now races through space towards the heart of the Drone army. There is only one mission to complete now: Kill All The Things!
